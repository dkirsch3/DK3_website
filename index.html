                 <p class="info-content">
                    Hello, my friends! I working on my way to try and become a software
                     engineer through <strong><a onmouseover = "changeBackground(event)" onmouseout="backToNormal(event)" 
                     href = "https://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron</a></strong>. 
                     I have had some experience coding in the 
                     past with <strong>VBA</strong> through Excel, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Mathematica</strong> The reason I am
                     now wanting to become a software engineer is because of a summer job
                     with <strong><a onmouseover = "changeBackground(event)" onmouseout="backToNormal(event)" 
                     href = "https://www.youthtechinc.com">Youth Tech Inc.</a></strong> where I was teaching kids how to code, make
                    websites and video games. I had to learn the basics on how to do each
                    of those and made me fall in love creating with these programs.

                    I am an avid sports fan and love the feel of competition. Football is by far my favorite
                    sport to watch with my favorite teams being the Dallas Cowboys and the Oklahoma State Cowboys.
                    I try and follow evey sport I can especially the teams in the Dallas area which does also include
                    esports teams like the Dallas Fuel for the video game Overwatch.
