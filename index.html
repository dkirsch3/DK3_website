            Hello, my friends! I working on my way to try and become a software
            engineer through <strong><a href = "https://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron</a></strong>. 
            I have had some experience coding in the 
            past with VBA through Excel, Python and Mathematica. The reason I am
            now wanting to become a software engineer is because of a summer job
            with Youth Tech Inc. where I was teaching kids how to code, make
            websites and video games. I had to learn the basics on how to do each
            of those and made me fall in love creating.
