                 <p class="info-content">
                    Hello, my friends! I working on my way to try and become a software
                     engineer through <strong><a onmouseover = "changeBackground(event)" onmouseout="backToNormal(event)" 
                     href = "https://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron</a></strong>. 
                     I have had some experience coding in the 
                     past with VBA through Excel, Python and Mathematica. The reason I am
                     now wanting to become a software engineer is because of a summer job
                     with <strong><a onmouseover = "changeBackground(event)" onmouseout="backToNormal(event)" 
                     href = "https://www.youthtechinc.com">Youth Tech Inc.</a></strong> where I was teaching kids how to code, make
                    websites and video games. I had to learn the basics on how to do each
                    of those and made me fall in love creating with these programs.
